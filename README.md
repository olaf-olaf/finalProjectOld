A digital drumpad for your iPhone. 

## Problem
Musicians like to jam all day long. However, when there's a jam going on in places without proper sound isolation a drum kit is simply to loud. Drumpad is an application that will allow the user to use his screen as a drumkit by converting the screen of his device into a Roland SPD style drumpad. Now can drum with a variety of sounds without being evicted due to noise complaints.

## External libraries

For this project I will either use the AVAudioPlayer class in swift or the audiokit library. Audiokit has more potential for extending functionality of the app than AVAudioPLayer but is really synthesis focused instead of sample focused. I have to consider whether audiokit will reduce the amount of code needed to implement this project. 

## Decompsing the app

### Model
